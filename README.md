# VANTAGE
## General Comments
This codebase is based around the test types used for the 2018-2019 development cycle. These included three types:
1. Simulation Testing
The simulation test was created using a combination of Cinema4D and Blensor, for the purpose of simulation the optical and TOF cameras, respectively. This suite ([VANTAGE_Simulation](https://github.com/vantagecu/VANTAGE_Simulation)) can be found in the [VANTAGE organization](https://github.com/vantagecu) repo. The truth data for this test is generated by the Cinema4D program itself.

2. Modular Testing
The modular test was developed for the purpose of testing the VANTAGE system from 0-10m. This test was performed in the CU RECUV lab, with truth data acquired using a system of VICON cameras.

3. 100m Testing
The 100m test was developed for the purpose of testing the system across the full 0-100m required range. This test was performed at the Boulder airport, using a test rig based on attaching CubeSats to a car, and acquiring truth data by affixing a GPS Trimble system to the car.

## Tools
Miscellaneous tools can be found in the *MiscTools/* directory.
### tofCropping

### PlotCubeSats
This tool is used to generate 3D scatter plots of the first CubeSat launched for a given test type. Output figures will then be saved to *FigureOut/*.
