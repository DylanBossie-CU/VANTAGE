# binaries

these binaries has been compiled for and tested on RHEL 6.9. They should work for most LINUX distros, but this is untested.

If you need the required binaries for another system, start at http://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/MoRePaS/software/mtocpp/docs/download.html and follow the steps provided there.

you should not actually need to put the mtocpp and mtocpp_post binaries on your path if they stay here in the */DoxygenDocs/config directory and you follow the rest of instructions in */DoxygenDocs/README
