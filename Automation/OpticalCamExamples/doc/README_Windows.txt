Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/
Download and install your preferable Python Version in den "Downloads" section.
When installing do enable additional "Precompile Standard library" and "Add Python 3.6 to PATH".

You will also need numpy and OpenCV. I advise to install them trough their wheel in the console.
For example, I downloaded and installed numpy with: pip install numpy-1.14.1+mkl-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
And OpenCV with: pip install opencv_python-3.4.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl

You will also need the uEye library.
Go to the official IDS website under the "Download" section, select "Interfaces" and then "Python".
Read the description and click on the link: https://pypi.org/project/pyueye/

You can download the needed package in the "Download Files" tab. 
Install it once more trough the console with: pip install pyueye-4.90.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
